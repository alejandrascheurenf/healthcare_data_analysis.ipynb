# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores a healthcare dataset to uncover trends in patient demographics, medical conditions, and billing patterns. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using Python. The analysis includes insights into chronic condition prevalence and billing trends, showcasing data analytics techniques applicable to healthcare.

## Dataset
- **Dataset**: [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) by Prasad22 on Kaggle.
- **Description**: Contains data on patient demographics, medical conditions, billing amounts, and hospital-related details.
- **License**: Refer to the dataset's Kaggle page for licensing details.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, blood type).
- Explore the prevalence of medical conditions across different groups.
- Investigate billing trends by medical condition, age, and gender.
- Demonstrate data cleaning and visualization techniques using Python.

## Key Findings
- Chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension are most prevalent among middle-aged and older populations.
- Billing amounts are consistent across demographics and conditions, averaging ~$25,000.
- Negative billing amounts, though rare, likely represent refunds or adjustments.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
  - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and presenting the analysis.
